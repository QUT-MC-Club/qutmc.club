### Installing things

To install mods, see the [Installing mods](../../installing-mods) page.

##  Fabric/Quilt Mods

<div class="notification type-info">
Most Fabric mods require the <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api">Fabric API</a> mod in order to work, while most Quilt mods require <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl">Quilted Fabric API</a> to work.
</div>

###  Sodium

[Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) is a mod that greatly improves render performance through various optimizations. We **highly recommend** installing it when possible.

If you use Sodium often, please consider supporting development of the mod by [donating](https://jellysquid.me/donate) to the developer!

###  Iris

[Iris](https://irisshaders.dev/) allows you to use OptiFine shaderpacks, while also running Sodium. It currently supports almost every shaderpack, [with some exceptions](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/blob/trunk/docs/supportedshaders.md#shaders-that-do-not-work-on-iris).

###  Other Mods

If you want to further improve your performance, please also consider installing [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight)! Do note that Starlight is no longer needed client-side if you're playing on Minecraft 1.20 or higher, as Mojang has optimized their lighting engine since then.

If you would like to go a bit further, LambdAurora maintains a very detailed list of OptiFine alternatives for Fabric and Quilt, which you can find [here](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/). There's also a list of mods made by the Additive modpack [here](https://github.com/skywardmc/additive/wiki/Give-up-OptiFine), which provides the Minecraft versions that each mod supports along with some extra information.

##  Forge/NeoForge Mods

## Older Ports - use for versions older than 1.21.1

<Aside type="caution">
<strong>Unlike on Fabric/Quilt, most unofficial ports of OptiFine alternatives for Forge might have some compatibility/stability issues.</strong>

While on some modpacks/with some mods they&#39;re going to work good, with others they might be <em>very</em> unstable so be well aware of what you&#39;re doing. If you have issues, use OptiFine.

You can use <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/connector">Sinytra Connector</a> to run many Fabric mods on Forge.

<strong>Don&#39;t report issues with those on upstream&#39;s Discord support channels!</strong>
