### Installing things

To install modpacks, see the [Installing mods](../../installing-mods) page.

##  Fabric/Quilt Modpacks

###  Fabulously Optimized

If you don't want to search and install these mods manually, then try the [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) modpack, which supports almost all OptiFine features.

[See the installation instructions](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#prism-launcher) for Prism Launcher.

###  Simply Optimized

[Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop) is a modpack designed with just optimization in mind. SO has better out-of-the-box performance than Fabulously Optimized, but it doesn't come with the QoL mods or full OptiFine parity you would see in Fabulously Optimized, so you're expected to add any additional mods you want yourself.

###  Adrenaline

[Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) is a Fabric/Quilt modpack which aims to improve performance as much as possible while not changing anything about the vanilla game, adding QOL features, or introducing instability. Like Simply Optimized, it does not come with any OptiFine replacement mods, so you'll have to manually install the features that you want.

###  Additive

[Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) is a modpack similar to Fabulously Optimized which aims to support nearly all OptiFine features. It's based on Adrenaline for better performance, supports both Fabric and Quilt, and can be installed on a wide range of Minecraft versions.

##  Forge Modpacks

###  Hammer

[Hammer](https://modrinth.com/modpack/hammer) is like the Adrenaline modpack but made for Forge, utilizing Forge ports of mods and [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) to run Fabric/Quilt optimization mods.

###  Drill

[Drill](https://modrinth.com/modpack/drill) is the Additive modpack but made for Forge, utilizing Forge ports of mods and [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) to run Fabric/Quilt optimization and OptiFine replacement mods.
