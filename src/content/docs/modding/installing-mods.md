title: Installing Mods
description: A reference page in my new Starlight docs site.

Installing mods is done through a [Mod Loader](./mod-loaders) and a .jar in the .minecraft/mods directory(normally). This can be done with the vanilla launcher by installing the [Mod Loader](./mod-loaders) directly however we would advise using a [Mod Launcher](./Launchers/desktop) instead.

## Why should I use a Mod Launcher?
While it is possible to use vanilla. Having a Modloader significantly simplifies the process allowing you to install modpacks and mods from a provider in one click instead of manually moving files.
Some formats of modpacks also require resolving and dont package the jar files directly so it would be impossible to load such as curseforges modpack `.zip (it only includes curseforge links)` files and Modrinths `.mrpacks`.

## What Mod Launcher should I use?

We have our suggestions and a full comparison:

- [Desktop Launchers](./Launchers/desktop) (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
- [Mobile Launchers](./Launchers/mobile) (Android, IOS, Meta Quest)

## Installing Modpacks

For new users its most likely you will be installing modpacks created by other users such as our [performance modpack reccomendations](./Reccomendations/performance-mods.md#Perform), otherwise for events we will link the required modpack.
