Work to hide the totem from the hunter for as long as possible.



Player options: Hider or Hunter

Start as Hider - Totem will be randomly given to a hider. This totem must be hidden from the hunter. The totem is passed from hider to hider by punching each other.


Start as Hunter - Hit players to try to find the totem. Use deduction and observation to find out who has the totem. Don't get confused as the totem is passed around!
