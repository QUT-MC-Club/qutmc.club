### Discord Rules
1. Be respectful
2. Keep channels on topic - conversations that are off topic that persist in the wrong channel will be deleted
3. Keep conversations peer appropriate
4. Don’t promote other servers or personal content – posting QUTMC builds is ok though
5. Text Channels: keep in mind, they are text channels - emphasis, tonality and all that lovely stuff we do with words when we speak doesn't come through text very well. Please keep that in mind when both sending messages and reading them.
6. Voice Channels: these are not private spaces and people, especially staff, may be recording your voice. No one, including staff are allowed to publish anything containing a person's voice without their permission. This is as a safety precaution in case we need evidence to apply certain rules. (permission to stream and record a person's voice is automatically given if the voice is recorded <#1273940230394744864>).
