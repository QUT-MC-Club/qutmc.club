Currently we only support <u>__Minecraft Java Edition__</u> on our servers. 

This is available for Windows 10-11, MacOS, Linux, Android([PojavLauncher]()) and Meta Quest([QuestCraft]())

We suggest using a [Mod Launcher]() to have voicechat and performance mods for our main servers, aswell as be able to join our modded event servers.
## Java Edition

To join our servers simply enter the ip below into the multiplayer section of minecraft.

<div class="sl-flex">
    <Code code="qutmc.club" lang="text"/>
</div>

once your game has started open `Multiplayer > Add Server`

If you wish to directly connect to our other servers instead of going to the minigames lobby you can use the ips below:

<div class="sl-flex">
    * Survival <Code code="survival.qutmc.club" lang="text"/>
</div>

Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.
