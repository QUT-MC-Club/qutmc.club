import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Currently we only support <u>__Minecraft Java Edition__</u> on our servers. 

**You must have purchased a Minecraft Account, we do not support offline accounts.**

This is available for Windows 10-11, MacOS, Linux, Android/IOS([PojavLauncher](../modding/Launchers/mobile)) and Meta Quest([QuestCraft](../modding/Launchers/mobile))

We suggest using a [Mod Launcher](../modding/Launchers/desktop) to have voicechat and performance mods for our main servers, aswell as be able to join our modded event servers.
## Java Edition

To join our servers simply enter the ip below into the multiplayer section of minecraft.

<div class="sl-flex">
    <Code code="qutmc.club" lang="text"/>
</div>

once your game has started open `Multiplayer > Add Server`

If you wish to directly connect to our other servers instead of going to the minigames lobby you can use the ips below:

<div class="sl-flex">
    * Survival <Code code="survival.qutmc.club" lang="text"/>
</div>
